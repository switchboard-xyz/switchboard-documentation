history buffer account stores a set number of accepted results for an aggregator, and given Solana\u2019s maximum account size of 10MB, the maximum number of samples a single history buffer can support is 350,000 samples. An aggregator can only have a single history buffer associated with it. This feature allows Switchboard task to parse a history buffer for its calculations, such as the TwapTask.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/feeds/job":{"id":"architecture/feeds/job","title":"Job","description":"When building data feeds, it is important to have a diverse set of jobs so a single failure doesn\u2019t cause unintended consequences.

The publisher is responsible for creating a lease contract to reserve a set amount of computer power from the oracle queue. Once a publisher\u2019s feed is accepted by the DAO, the feed is added to the network and granted permissions to use the oracle queue resources.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/oracle-queue":{"id":"architecture/oracle-queue","title":"Oracle Queue","description":"An oracle queue governs a realm of oracles, data feeds, and randomness accounts. An oracle queue, and most of the other Switchboard accounts, have an authority field which specifies which keypair is permitted to make account changes.

An oracle queue is responsible for managing realm permissions and assigning oracles to aggregator updates in a round robin fashion. When an oracle is assigned an update request, it reads in the aggregator job definitions, executes each job, takes the median of the job results, then publishes its result on-chain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/oracles/oracle-buffer":{"id":"architecture/oracles/oracle-buffer","title":"Oracle Buffer","description":"An oracle queue buffer stores the list of active oracles for a queue.
