| varianceThreshold     | [BorshDecimal](/idl/types/BorshDecimal) | Change percentage required between a previous round and the current round. If variance percentage is not met, reject new oracle responses. |
| forceReportPeriod     | i64                                     | Number of seconds for which, even if the variance threshold is not passed, accept new responses from oracles.                              |
