<b><u>Privacy & The Blockchain:</u></b>

A key feature of many blockchain technologies, including Solana (the blockchain on which the Company’s services are founded), is the transparency and public accessibility of on-chain transactions. This includes but is in no way limited to your public sending address (“<b>public key</b>”) and any other information that you choose to include. Additionally, information stored on-chain (including without limitation via the Protocol) may be public, immutable, and not easily removed or deleted and, in many cases, cannot be deleted. Your public addresses may reveal information about you and this information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. If you are unfamiliar with blockchain technology and its transparent and public nature, we strongly encourage you to study how information is stored on blockchain technology before electing to use the Website or our services, or the Protocol. 

<b><u>Your Choices:</u></b>

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information: 
<b>Tracking Technologies and Advertising</b>. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
