PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. 
THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

YOU MAY NOT USE OUR WEBSITE OR SERVICES IF YOU: (A) DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS; (B) ARE NOT THE OLDER OF (i) AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE OR (ii) LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT; OR (C) ARE PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OF THIS WEBSITE'S FUNCTIONALITIES BY APPLICABLE LAW.</b>

Acceptance of the Terms of Use.

These terms of use are entered into by and between you (the “<b>User</b>”) and Switchboard Technology Labs, Inc (the “<b>Company</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” “<b>our</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (<i>collectively</i>, the “<b>Terms of Use</b>”), govern the User’s access to and use of https://switchboard.xyz, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through https://switchboard.xyz (the “<b>Website</b>”).

The User must read the Terms of Use carefully before it starts to use the Website. <b>By using the Website, the User accepts and agrees to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference.</b> If the User does not want to agree to these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or any documents that are incorporated herein by reference, the User must not access or use the Website. 
This Website is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using this Website, the User represents and warrants that the User is at least the higher of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company in the User’s applicable jurisdiction or eighteen (18) years of age, and meets all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. Further, by using this Website, the User represents and warrants that the User is not a citizen or resident of, nor is located in, any country against which the United States has sanctioned or embargoed or where the use of the Website is otherwise illegal or impermissible, whether by rule, statute, regulation, bylaw, court adjudication or order, protocol, administrative statement, code, decree, or other directive, requirement or guideline, whether applicable on the Company, the Website, the Services, or on the User (or multiple of the foregoing) by an authority with valid and enforceable jurisdiction (“<b>Applicable Laws</b>”). If the User does not meet all of these requirements, the User must not access or use the Website.
The Services.
The Website provides access to aggregated information about the Solana Network (“<b>Solana</b>”), including information high-performance mechanisms that provide information in a form that Solana can understand (“<b>Oracle(s)</b>”) and other forms of support to Solana and its community. The Website displays certain types of informational feeds provided by Switchboard Oracles (“<b>Feeds</b>”), open-source documentation and related services, including but not limited to Oracle and node operation software code repositories and related resources, application programming interface (“<b>API</b>”) interfacing and informational guides, information about our software and the Website, and other resources for our community and the Solana community at large. The Website also provides an interface for interaction (the “<b>Interface</b>”) with the Switchboard decentralized suite of smart contracts powered by Solana to enable collaboration, communication, and compensation for those desiring information from Oracles and those who serve in such capacity (the “<b>Protocol</b>”) The services described in this paragraph, except the Protocol itself, are collectively referred to as the “<b>Services</b>.” 
Relation between the Website, Interface, Protocol, and User.
The Protocol allows those who interact with it to transact, communicate, and facilitate transactions related to the provision of Oracle functionality to the Solana ecosystem. The Protocol exists separately to the Services, and may involve payment between its participants related to its functioning. The Protocol’s open-source document repository may be found at [GITHUB HYPERLINK]. The Protocol is facilitated by a wide range of Solana community members and technologies. Payments transmitted via the Protocol shall be made according to its programmatic terms (which are provided as is), and the Company makes no warranty or representation whatsoever related to Protocol or its proper functioning as intended. BY USING THE PROTOCOL, YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE USING IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
The Interface is the Company’s centralized user interface that allows parties to easily access the Protocol. However, the Interface is not the exclusive means of accessing the Protocol, and by using the Interface, the User may be interacting with participants who are not engaged with the Company under any form of formal relationship. While the Company may take certain actions related to the Services, Website, and Interface, it may not be able to do the same as related to the Protocol. For example, once a transaction or action is processed by the Protocol (whether submitted via the Interface or otherwise), it cannot be modified by the Company or any other discrete party. User hereby acknowledges the foregoing, represents that it is technically sophisticated enough to understand the distinction between the Protocol and the Services, and agrees to waive any and all claims or liability against the Company whatsoever related to the Protocol or the transactions it facilitates.
Blockchain Fees.
The User’s full use and enjoyment of the Services may require the User to pay transactional fees required by Solana or another related blockchain or distributed ledger service (“<b>Blockchain Fees</b>”). These Blockchain Fees are not levied or collected directly by the Company, but rather are determined by the User’s use of the Services and Solana according to the rules placed by the Solana community at large. The User acknowledges that the Company has no control over Blockchain Fees (including, without limitation, their applicability, payment, amounts, transmission, and effectiveness) whether related to the User’s use of the Services or otherwise, and the User agrees that in no event will the Company be responsible to the User or any other party for the payment, repayment, refund, disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of the User’s use or transmission of Blockchain Fees.
&emsp;•  Changes to the Terms of Use.
We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice before the date the change is posted on the Website. 
The User’s continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that the User accepts and agrees to the changes. <b>The User is expected to check this page each time it accesses this Website so the User is aware of any changes, as they are binding on the User.</b>

The User also agrees to ensure that it will lock or otherwise prevent its Web3 Utility from unauthorized use on this Website or the Services at the end of each session. If the User knows, believes, or has reason to believe that its private key associated with a Web3 Utility has been unintentionally compromised by or exposed to another party, the User should transfer any assets or authorities associated with that private key to a newly generated, secure private key and cease using the previous one. The User should use particular caution when accessing the Website or the Services from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record the User’s password, private key, or other personal information. The Company is not responsible for any harms, damages, claims, injuries, or complaints related to the User’s lost or compromised private key. 
We have the right to disable any identity associated with a Web3 Utility (such as that represented by a public address) on the Website or to block any IP address from accessing the Website at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, the User or that identity has violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

&emsp;•  Nature of Blockchain; Assumption of Risk; Waiver of Claims.
Blockchains (including, without limitation, Solana), the Protocol, and Oracles are still emerging technologies that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, informational, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with blockchains, the Protocol, and Oracles requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including, without limitation, use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies, such as blockchains like Solana, is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with the Protocol and Solana may be publicly visible and readable in human form. Regarding Oracles, while the Services attempt to utilize blockchain technology to mitigate some risks represented by Oracles, it is nonetheless possible that unexpected technical phenomena, intentionally malicious or accidental behaviors by other Participants or other users, or other foreseen or unforeseen phenomena may cause Oracles’ inaccuracy or malfunctioning, which may cause suspension or interruption to the Website or any functionalities that depend on their proper behaviors (including the Feeds’ display).
By accessing and using the Website or the Services, the User acknowledges the foregoing and agrees and represents that it understands and assumes such and other risks involved with blockchains and Oracles (including any specific technical language used in these Terms of Use). The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is informed of all foreseeable risks, and the possibility of unforeseeable risks, associated with blockchains, the Protocol, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, APIs, Oracles, and the Services. The User further acknowledges, and assumes all risk related to the possibility, that any information presented via the Website, Interface, other Services, or Feeds may be inaccurate, possibly due to another party’s malicious activities and possibly to the User’s severe harm or detriment. The User understands, acknowledges, and agrees that we are not responsible for any of these or related risks, do not own or control Solana, cannot guarantee the safe or accurate functioning of the Services (including the Feeds or the Interface, which rely on Oracles enabled by the Protocol and Solana), and shall not be held liable for any resulting harms, damages, or losses incurred by or against the User experiences while accessing or using the Website. <b>Accordingly, the User acknowledges the foregoing, represents its understanding of the foregoing, and agrees to assume full responsibility for all risks associated with accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Services, whether mentioned in this Section or otherwise. The User further expressly waives and releases us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to the User’s use of the Website and the User’s interaction with the Services.</b> 
If the User is a California resident, <b>the User expressly and explicitly waives the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542</b>, which states: “[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”
&emsp;•  No Professional Advice.
All information or content provided or displayed by the Website (including, without limitation, the Interface or the Feeds) is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice (including, without limitation, tax, legal, or financial advice). The User should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information or content displayed or provided on the Website or through the Services. The User should seek independent professional advice from an individual licensed and qualified in the area appropriate for such before the User makes any financial, legal, or other decisions where such is considered prudent. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permissible by law, it has not relied on the Company, the Feeds, or the Services for any professional advice related to its financial or legal behaviors.
&emsp;•  No Fiduciary Duties.
These Terms of Use, and the provision of the Website, Interface, and the other Services, are not intended to create any fiduciary duties between us and the User or any third-party. To the fullest extent permissible by law, the User agrees that neither the User’s use of the Website or the Services causes us or any Participant to owe fiduciary duties or liabilities to the User or any third party. Further, the User acknowledges and agrees to the fullest extent such duties or liabilities are afforded by law or by equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated, and that we and any other Participant shall be held completely harmless in relation thereof. The User further agrees that the only duties and obligations that we or any Participant owes the User, and the only rights the User has related to these Terms of Use or the User’s use of the Website or the Services, are those set out expressly in these Terms of Use.
&emsp;•  Links from the Website.
If the Website may contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for convenience only. This includes links contained in advertisements, including banner advertisements and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and the User acknowledges and agrees that we do not and will not accept any responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from the User’s use of them. If the User decides to access any of the third-party websites linked to this Website, the User does so entirely at its own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites.
&emsp;•  Indemnification.
The User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (1) the User’s violation of these Terms of Use; (2) the User’s use of the Website, Protocol, Interface, or any of the Services, including, but not limited to, your User Contributions, the User’s interactions with the other features which incorporate the Services, use of or reliance on the Website’s content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use; (3) the User’s use or reliance on of any information obtained from the Website (including the Interface); or (4) any other party’s access and use of the Website or Services with the User’s assistance or by using any device or account that the User owns or control.
&emsp;•  Governing Law.
All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdiction).
&emsp;•  Arbitration; Class Arbitration Waiver. 
Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the User’s use of the Website or the Services, or in connection with these Terms of Use, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association under its Rules of Arbitration. The tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. Arbitration shall occur in the city of Miami, Florida. <b>The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that these Terms of Use do not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding.</b> The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the arbitration agreement will remain in force.
&emsp;•  Limitation on Time to File Claims.
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM THE USER MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR ITS USE OF THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
&emsp;•  Waiver and Severability.
No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
