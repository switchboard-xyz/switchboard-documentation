# Introduction

## What is an Oracle

Smart contracts are the building blocks of web3 and can be thought of as the logic behind programmable money, although their use cases extend well beyond just monetary transactions. A smart contract encapsulates some pre-defined logic allowing anonymous participants to interact without a trusted intermediary. More complex smart contracts might rely on external data from the web but blockchains do not have the capability of directly relaying this information. Enter oracles.

Oracles are the gateway between a blockchain and the real world, providing the mechanisms to arrive at a reliable consensus for a single data point when given multiple sources. Oracles can then determine the most reliable value of the data point after examining the provided answer of each data source. In this way, oracles increase information integrity by removing the risk of a single point of failure or outlier.

## Rewards

Oracles are rewarded for their compute time to incentivize honest behavior. If enough oracles successfully respond to a data feed update request, an on-chain program aggregates the assigned oracle results and returns the median value as the final result. Each oracle is then scored based on their response. The variance threshold is dictated by the DAO on a per queue basis and is used when determining the validity of an oracle’s response in relation to the accepted, median result. Oracles within the acceptable range are awarded whatever fee is set by the DAO. Oracles who’s responses fall outside the acceptable range will be slashed and must forfeit a set amount of their staked capital. The slashing mechanism disincentivizes oracles from reporting dishonest data and helps protect the system from nodes who may have other incentives to return false data.

## Requirements

Running an oracle allows you to contribute to the switchboard network and get compensated for your compute time. In order to run a node and avoid slashing, you should have the following:

- Dedicated RPC endpoint with reliable up-time
- Cloud hosting provider (preferebly Google Cloud Platform to start)
- Staked SOL

A Switchboard oracle can be run on any cloud provider who offers kubernetes services but this guide will currently be focued on Google Cloud. Feel free to contribute to our documentation if you are running an oracle on another provider. Here's some extra reading to learn more about kubernetes:
