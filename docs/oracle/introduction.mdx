# Introduction

## Requirements

Running an oracle allows you to contribute to the switchboard network and get compensated for your compute time. In order to run a node and avoid slashing, you should have the following:

- Dedicated RPC endpoint with reliable up-time
- Cloud hosting provider (preferebly Google Cloud Platform to start)
- Staked SOL

A Switchboard oracle can be run on any cloud provider who offers kubernetes services but this guide will currently be focued on Google Cloud. Feel free to contribute to our documentation if you are running an oracle on another provider. Here's some extra reading to learn more about kubernetes:
