# Introduction

An oracle is a node (server) that sits between the Solana blockchain and the internet and facilitates the flow of data. When requested, an oracle reads in an aggregators job accounts, executes each task, and publishes its result on-chain. Oracles must be available 24/7/365 or risk losing a portion of their staked capital.

## Requirements

Running an oracle allows you to contribute to the switchboard network and get compensated for your compute time. In order to run a node and avoid slashing, you should have the following:

- Dedicated RPC endpoint with reliable up-time
- Cloud hosting provider (preferebly Google Cloud Platform to start)
- Staked SOL

## Rewards

Oracles are rewarded for their compute time to incentivize honest behavior. If enough oracles successfully respond to a data feed update request, an on-chain program aggregates the assigned oracle results and returns the median value as the final result. Each oracle is then scored based on their response. The variance threshold is dictated by the DAO on a per queue basis and is used when determining the validity of an oracle’s response in relation to the accepted, median result. Oracles within the acceptable range are awarded whatever fee is set by the DAO. Oracles who’s responses fall outside the acceptable range will be slashed and must forfeit a set amount of their staked capital. The slashing mechanism disincentivizes oracles from reporting dishonest data and helps protect the system from nodes who may have other incentives to return false data.

## DAO Approval

Oracles must first be approved by the DAO before receiving any aggregator update request.

- **Oracle Account** - Create oracle account using the oracleQueue public key
- **Stake Account** - Fund the staking account
- **Submit DAO Approval** - Submit DAO approval to the discord for community voting.
