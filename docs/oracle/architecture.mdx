# Oracle Architecture

A Switchboard oracle is a Node.js container that sits between the Solana blockchain and the internet and waits for update requests from an oracle queue. An oracle queue assigns updates to oracles in a round robin fashion.

An oracle account is a program derived address (PDA) between the oracle queue itâ€™s being initialized for, as well as the oracles staking wallet. Before an oracle is granted permissions to use a queue, it must transfer the minimum stake amount, set by the queue, to its staking wallet.

## Staking

An oracle is required to transfer `queue.minStake` tokens to its staking wallet, `oracle.tokenAccount`, before being granted queue permissions. The minStake acts as an insurance policy to entice honest oracle behavior.

## Heartbeat

An oracle is required to heartbeat on-chain in order to join the queue and be assigned update request. An oracle must heartbeat before the queue's specified `queue.oracleTimeout` or it will be removed from the queue by the queue's garbage collector.

## Metrics

The oracle also tracks its performance, `oracle.metrics`.

## Cost & Reward Estimations

An oracle is required to submit an [aggregatorSaveResult](/idl/instructions/aggregatorSaveResult) transaction each time it updates a feed, which incurs a cost of 5000 lamports. This fee is set by the Solana network and is subject to change.

$T_{perUpdate}=T_{queueReward} - 5000$

where,

- `T` is the raw token amount in base units (_Ex: lamports or satoshis_)

To estimate an oracles cost basis, you will need to know a queue's capacity (Oracles, Feeds, VRFs) and the average number of update request an oracle is assigned over a given time period.

You will also need to factor in the oracle's heartbeat cost, which is 5000 lamports each. The number of heartbeats is dependent on its `queue.oracleTimeout`, which determines how often an oracle is required to heartbeat.
