# Oracle Requirements

Running an oracle allows you to contribute to the switchboard network and get compensated for your compute time. In order to run a node and avoid slashing, you should have the following:

- Dedicated RPC endpoint with reliable up-time
- Cloud hosting provider
- Staked SOL

<!-- Add flow diagram for how oracle is added to the network -->
