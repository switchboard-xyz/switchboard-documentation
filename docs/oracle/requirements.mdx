# Introduction

An oracle is a node (server) that sits between the Solana blockchain and the internet and facilitates the flow of data.

## Oracle Requirements

Running an oracle allows you to contribute to the switchboard network and get compensated for your compute time. In order to run a node and avoid slashing, you should have the following:

- Dedicated RPC endpoint with reliable up-time
- Cloud hosting provider
- Staked SOL
