# Cloud Providers

A Switchboard oracle can be run on any cloud provider who offers kubernetes services but this guide will currently be focued on Google Cloud. Feel free to contribute to our documentation if you are running an oracle on another provider.

## Google Cloud

You will need a Google Cloud Platform account with the [Cloud SDK installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Once installed, login to your google cloud account:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```
