# Buffer Relayer Architecture

A buffer relayer enables a single oracle to fetch and publish a raw buffer on-chain. Currently buffer relayers support a maximum size of 500 bytes so it fits into a single transaction, although theoretically this could be expanded to ~10Mb and spread out across multiple transactions. If you need a buffer larger than 500 bytes, reach out to the Switchboard team.

## Consensus

A buffer relayer has no consensus mechanism in that whatever the oracle publishes will be the accepted result; so some degree of trust is needed between the requester and the oracle. Buffer relayers are provided for convenience so developers can easily route data on-chain and should not be used for securing sensitive systems.

## Queue Permissions

_Not all queues support buffer relayers._ A queue must explicitly set `queue.enableBufferRelayers` before oracles will respond to update request.

A permission account is always required before use. If a queue has `queue.unpermissionedFeedsEnabled` then no assigned permissions are required. If a queue has not enabled unpermissioned feeds, then a buffer relayer is required to be granted **_PERMIT_ORACLE_QUEUE_USAGE_** from the `queue.authority` before oracles will respond to any update request.

## Cost

A buffer relayer must fund their `escrow` account in order to request an oracle to publish a buffer on-chain. Each update request deducts `queue.reward` from the buffers `escrow` account when the oracle responds on-chain.
