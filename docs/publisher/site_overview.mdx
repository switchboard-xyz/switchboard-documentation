# Overview

The publisher site is a decentralized marketplace that allows anyone to build a bundle and deploy it onchain. A bundle (aggregator) is a collection of data sources that get executed onchain to determine a single result. The publisher site includes some predefined bundles but also offers the ability to add custom sources. When you have your data sources selected, you will have the ability to configure how frequent your feed will be updated. The publisher site will then request the funds from the connected wallet and create the necessary onchain accounts.

Once you have a feed published onchain, you can use the publisher to monitor the feed, extend the lease, or close the lease and withdraw remaining funds.
