# Creating Bundles

## Template Bundles

Creating a template bundle is as easy as browsing the catalog and adding the bundles to your basket. Once in your basket, you can toggle the individual data sources to meet your needs. You may wish to ignore certain sources if they have insufficient volume or known down time.
