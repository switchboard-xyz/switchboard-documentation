## About Switchboard

Switchboard is a community-driven, decentralized oracle network built on Solana that allows anyone to publish on-chain data for smart contract developers to reliably build upon. Switchboard is a community governed protocol — if additional on-chain data is needed, head over to our documentation to learn how to spin up your own data feeds. Or reach out to learn more.
Solana was chosen for its sub-second transaction speed, allowing faster refresh rates of on-chain data to help support it’s thriving developer ecosystem. Developing an oracle solution in this high-availability environment poses its own set of challenges that the Switchboard team is excited to solve!
Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, when operators would shuffle telephone lines around a switchboard to complete a circuit and forward a dialer’s call to the next hop in the circuit. Similarly, Switchboard is responsible for how external data gets updated and routed through the Solana blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.
