# Job

A job account contains the blueprint for how an oracle retrieves data off-chain and arrives at a single value. Typically the first task in a job will fetch external data with subsequent tasks responsible for parsing the response and transforming the value into a single data type, like an integer or decimal.

## Task Definitions

The table below contains the different task available to retrieve data off-chain. More information can be found [here](https://switchboard-protodoc.tiiny.site/#OracleJob).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Task Name</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Http</td>
    <td>
      report the text body of a successful HTTP request to the specified url, or
      return an error if the response status code is greater than or equal to
      400
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Websocket</td>
    <td>Opens and maintains a websocket for light speed data retrieval</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JsonParse</td>
    <td>
      Walks the path specified and returns the value found at that result. If
      returning JSON data from the HttpGet or HttpPost adapters, you must use
      this adapter to parse the response
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mean</td>
    <td>Take the mean of all the provided subtasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Median</td>
    <td>
      This task will take the median of the results of the nested tasks. Nested
      tasks must return a Number.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Multiply</td>
    <td>Multiply a numerical input by a scalar value or by another</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Divide</td>
    <td>Divide a numerical input by a scalar value or by another</td>
  </tr>
