:::caution

While Switchboard V2's oracle network is fully audited, the VRF implementation is currently unaudited software. Please use at your own risk.

:::

While true-randomness on some computers can be made possible via atmospheric noise and special hardware modules, such solutions on blockchains are not possible since they are virtual machines without physical hardware. Thus, pseudorandom-functions are needed to close this gap. **_You should be skeptical of teams claiming they offer true randomness._**

Random numbers are crucial for many DeFi applications whether its fair NFT launches, gambling, gaming, or assigning user roles in a DAO. Without an element of randomness, each of the above could be exploited and the final outcome predicted.

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is a public-key pseudorandom function that provides proofs that its outputs were calculated correctly. This means we can use a cryptographic keypair to generate a random number with a proof, which can then be validated by anyone to ensure the value was calculated correctly without the possibility of leaking the producer’s secret key. You can read more about VRF from the Algorand team, whose founder was one of the authors on the original VRF paper - [Algorand Releases First Open Source Code of Verifiable Random Functions](https://medium.com/algorand/algorand-releases-first-open-source-code-of-verifiable-random-function-93c2960abd61).

Switchboard's VRF implementation uses the oracle authority secret key to publish the VRF proof on-chain. The on-chain proof verification is very computationally expensive and requires 276 instructions on-chain to fully verify. Once the proof is submitted on-chain anyone can turn the VRF crank to produce the pseduorandom result, although for simplicity and speed the Switchboard oracle that submitted the proof also submits the verification instructions.

The final proof verification instruction invokes the VRF Account's specified callback, which allows developers to integrate pseduorandomness into their applications and be confident they are consuming the latest pseduorandom result.

## Configuration

## Integration

Switchboard's VRF implementation allows the creator to specify a program callback that will be called each time a new proof is verified on-chain.

### Callback

When creating a VRF Account, the VRF `vrf.authority` _should_ specify a `vrf.callback` function that will be called by the oracle when a new randomness value is produced.

<CallbackZC />

### Pseudorandom Result

The VRF function produces a **_u8[32]_** buffer, `vrf.result`, that can be transmuted to most data types using the [bytemuck crate](https://crates.io/crates/bytemuck).

```rust
let result_buffer: [u8; 32];
// get result buffer from parsed VRF Account
msg!("Result buffer is {:?}", result_buffer);
let value: &[u128] = bytemuck::cast_slice(&result_buffer[..]);
msg!("u128 buffer {:?}", value);
let result = value[0] % max_result as u128;
msg!("Current VRF Value [0 - {}) = {}!", max_result, result);
```

## Update Cost

A VRF Account is required to have `0.002 wrapped SOL` in their `vrf.escrow` before requesting randomness. If the `vrf.escrow` has insufficient funds, the difference will be deducted from the requesters token wallet. The oracle fulfilling the crank will receive `0.002 / 277 wrapped SOL` upon submitting the proof, with the remaining amount being dispersed to the account who turned the VRF crank, which is typically the oracle.

## Update Lifecycle

### Update Request

- The `vrf.authority` calls [vrfRequestRandomness](/idl/instructions/vrfRequestRandomness)
- sbv2 program checks if the request is valid by:
  - The previous `vrf.status` is equal to **_StatusNone_**, **_StatusCallbackSuccess_**, or **_StatusVerifyFailure_**
  - The previous `vrf.status` is equal to **_StatusRequesting_**, **_StatusVerifying_**, or **_StatusVerified_** and one minute has elapsed since the previous VRF request
- sbv2 program sets the current `vrf.status` to **_StatusRequesting_**
- sbv2 program checks the requester provided the required oracle reward and transfers it to `vrf.escrow`
- sbv2 program increments `vrf.counter`
- sbv2 program emits [VrfRequestRandomnessEvent](/idl/events/VrfRequestRandomnessEvent)

### Oracle Execution

- Oracle watches the chain for a [VrfRequestRandomnessEvent](/idl/events/VrfRequestRandomnessEvent) with the oracle's public key assigned to the update request
- Oracle calculates the VRF proof and submits a [vrfProveAndVerify](/idl/instructions/vrfProveAndVerify) instruction on-chain
  - Oracle receives 1 / 277 of the reward
- sbv2 program sets the current `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerifying_**
- Oracle submits 276 × [vrfProveAndVerify](/idl/instructions/vrfProveAndVerify) instructions on-chain
  - Invoker receives 1 / 277 of the reward per each successful instruction
- If proof verification fails,
  - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerifyFailure_**
- If proof verification succeeds,
  - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusVerified_**
  - Oracle invokes `vrf.callback`
  - If `vrf.callback` is successfully invoked,
    - sbv2 program sets `vrf.status` to **_StatusCallbackSuccess_**
